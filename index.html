            <h3>Pure student and Bachelor boy</h3>
            <p>
                Myself Masudur Rahman. I am from Mymensingh, Bangladesh. I have completed my secondary and Higher
                secondary school certificate from Royal Media college, Mymensingh. Currently, I am studying Bachelor of
                Science in Computer Science Engineering at Daffodil International University which is a reputed
                university in Bangladesh. I have a great interest in computers and programming that's why I choose to
                study at CSE for higher study. I like to play badminton, football, and cricket. my hobbies are cycling,
                singing, cooking, and traveling. I can cook traditional dishes. I have traveled to many interesting
                places in Bangladesh and have a dream to travel the world. I wanted to be a good programmer and build my
                own IT farm. I am a humble person with a soft mind. Sometimes I feel shy to talk with the unknown but
                when I get to know them I can communicate very well. I always try to speak the truth and always try to
                be genteel and honest.That's all about me. Thank you.
            </p>

                    They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web developer. I made their website and
                    showed
                    it to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.
